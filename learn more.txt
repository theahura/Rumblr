Rumblr is a Google-integrated social competition service. Simply log in with your Google account to experience fighting on a whole new level.
Users can define tags for types of Rumbles, flip through profiles of others near them, and decide to Rumble them in the competition of their choice. They can then message each other to schedule a Rumble, and then go back to record the results. Rumblr even has a built-in feature to automatically resolve both parties declaring themselves the winner - after one day of stagnancy, a winner is picked at random. And Rumbles are recorded on your profile, so you can track your victories whenever you go, no matter the tag.
