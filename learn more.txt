Rumblr is a Google-integrated social competition service. Simply log in with your Google account to experience fighting on a whole new level.
Users can define tags for types of Rumbles, flip through profiles of others near them, and decide to Rumble them in the competition of their choice. They can then message each other to schedule a Rumble, and then go back to record the results. Rumblr even has a built-in feature to automatically resolve both parties declaring themselves the winner - after one day of stagnancy, a winner is picked at random. And Rumbles are recorded on your profile, so you can track your victories whenever you go, no matter the tag.

==========================

REMATCH
After the Rumble, report your results to your public profile and start tracking your stats, including win percent, favorite types of Rumbles and more. Previous oppenents stick around, so a rematch is easy. 


==================

Since the dawn of time, there has been conflict.
People fought each other over berries, bits of land and massive underground oil reserves,
But now, with this revolutionary new app, fighting will take on an entirely new dimension.
Gone are the days of street fights, of messy, unorganized mobs with baseball bats and guns. Rumblr brings
social media to an entire new ecosystem by letting combatants meet up online and have a
carefully scheduled, pre-arranged fight. Blunt weapons only? Okay! No crews? It's as good as done!
Just connect your Google account and you can be scheduling a fight with a complete stranger 
in as little as a minute.
But the fun doesn't stop there! Rumblr's versatility of user-defined tags means that fights don't
have to be limited to fists or edged weapons. Want to take your friend in Smash 4 or who can
eat the most human teeth? The possibilites are endless!
And after recording your win, you can see your lifetime Rumblr stats, including percent won, most
popular tags, and more!
